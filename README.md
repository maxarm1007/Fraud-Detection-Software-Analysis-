# Fraud-Detection-Software-Analysis-

<h2>Description</h2>
This project evaluates the performance of a fraud detection software using real-world banking data. By leveraging SQL for in-depth analysis and Power BI for data visualization, I extracted critical insights into the effectiveness of fraud detection mechanisms. Please see files for all queries and tables or see below for project sample walkthrough
<br />


<h2>Key Features Used</h2>

•	SQL-Based Analysis – Queried and analysed banking transactions to assess fraud detection accuracy.

•	 Database Management – Utilized SQLite and DBeaver to manage and manipulate large datasets.

•	Power BI Integration – Connected SQL Server to Power BI to create dynamic dashboards for data-driven insights.

•	Fraud Trends & Performance Metrics – Identified patterns, false positives, and system efficiency in detecting fraudulent activities.


<h2>Software Used </h2>

Languages & Utilities: SQL (SQLite)\
Software: DBeaver, Power BI

<h2>Notes</h2>

This repository contains sample SQL queries that demonstrate my ability to work with databases, analyze data efficiently, and integrate insights into interactive visual reports.

Skills demonstrated: Data Analysis, SQL Query Optimization, Data Visualization, Fraud Detection Metrics
